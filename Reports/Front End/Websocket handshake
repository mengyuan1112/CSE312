Websocket(Frontend):

Websocket client applications use the WebSocket API to communicate with the server using the WebSocket protocol
In the WebSocket API, the browser and the server only need to do a handshake action, and then a fast channel
 is formed between the browser and the server. Data can be transferred directly between the two.
The browser sends a request to establish a WebSocket connection to the server through JavaScript.
After the connection is established, the client and server can directly exchange data through the TCP connection.
After the Web Socket connection, the user can send data to the server through the send() method,
and receive the data returned by the server through the onmessage event.
The link below explains the whole process of how websocket handshake works and the code looks like.
	-Creating a websocket object
	-Sending data to the server
	-Receiving message from the server and interpret JSON object
	-Close connection
